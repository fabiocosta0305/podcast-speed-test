Download performance test designed for podcast media and feeds. This is ideal for raw server speed testing, as it loads only the data at the URL, not any of the embeds or links.

## Installation

This script requires Node.js 10.15 or higher. To install:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/theDanielJLewis/podcast-speed-test.git
cd podcast-speed-test/
npm i
```

## Run

```shell
npm start
```

And then point your browser to the test's location with port 4000. For example, if running on your local machine, visit `http://localhost:4000`. Replace `localhost` with the IP address of your server if hosting this remotely.

## JSON test formats

Use one of the included test files, or make your own in the following format.

```json
{
    "title": "TITLE OF TEST",
    "file": "OPTIONAL FILENAME FOR PLOTLY TO OVERWRITE",
    "tests": [
        {
            "label": "TEST LABEL 1",
            "url": "TEST_1_FEED_URL"
        },
        {
            "label": "TEST LABEL 2",
            "url": "TEST_2_FEED_URL"
        },
        {
            "label": "TEST LABEL 3",
            "url": "TEST_3_FEED_URL"
        },
        {
            "label": "TEST LABEL 4 (USED FOR BENCHMARK)",
            "url": "TEST_4_FEED_URL"
        }
    ]
}
```
